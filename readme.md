#  AI in coding and installation workshop spring 24'
## Contents
- lines is a nice basic for demonstrating coding around locations in space (using mouse for simulating people movement)
- in utils_code_for_students you'll find p5 and processing code that runs a simulation of people walking in space, and clearly shows where to put your code to see what would happen. 
its also possible to add/remove people with arrows and add a mouse simulation.
- (Advanced, in case you want to dive into things) fuller simulation - python code (needs some installations see requirements.txt) python/run_detection_server.py runs the code that detects objects, (DUMMY mode available). Use it together with client_processing to see interaction. first run the python server then the processing code. 
- Possible objects that can be detected (not so recommended, quality is not assured for stuff other than people) is in run_detection_server.py line 15

### Contents you shouldn't care about (internal mechanisms for making it all work)
- lines_demo is a demo using mouse for two projectors projection with no shadows (not ready yet)
- calibrate_cam has code for calibrating the camera (not ready yet)
- calibrate_cam has code for calibrating the projection (not ready yet(?))
- python folder has code to calculate the trasformation matrices and run the detections server (needs tidying up)
- use_transformation has code to project some crap using the projection transformation (one projector at the moment)
- resources holds the files, media etc.
